# 🗝 Login
- Two method：
  - Encrypted file login: select the encrypted file saved when registering and enter the password
  - Private key login: enter the private key
# 📃 Rent
1. Download SSH tool [`MobaXterm`](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RPuF9x20oFYNsfPw03F2wFVmelo1npUr)
2. Open 🚀`AI Power` website, click “machine llist”, wait about 10 seconds for the list of available machines to be displayed. Then choose one server to trial or rent. It is recommended to set a little more time, when the time is over, the system will automatically shut down the server. If the task runs out in advance, you can go to "my GPU list" and cancel the rental, the rest of the time will be returned to your account by DBC.

3. Confirm the order
- ![](resource/en/e13.png)
4. It will jump to the corresponding CPU/GPU container page and let’s wait for the system to check the machine environment
- ![](resource/en/e14.png)
5. After the check, let's click “支付(pay)” and then you will receive an email containing the account and password of the server and some information
- ![](resource/en/e15.png)
6. Open MobaXterm and select "New session" to create a New connection
- ![](resource/r17.png)
7. Enter the server address and port number, and then click OK

8. Enter the account(root) and the password (No characters are displayed during the input). Press enter and click "Yes"
- ![](resource/r19.png)
9. After successfully logging in, you can use the server normally. You can manage the server files on the left and  there is a terminal on the right. Enter the `server file name .py` to run the python script, which has been preinstalled with Pytorch, Tensorflow, and so on the right. During formal training, it is recommended to use the screen command (`screen -S name`) to create an offline terminal. The training file on the offline terminal is more stable. Even if you exit locally, the server will continue to execute the script. The next time you log in to the server, you can use the command `screen -r -d name` to enter the previously created terminal.

- By configuring `X11-uploding`, you can even write scripts directly in the local graphical interface or display the graphical interface of the server-side software.

## ☄ How to use Pycharm to connect to the server?
- Only Professional version of Pycharm has ssh interpreter function.
## ☄ Why is there no preset frame?
- Only python3 has a preset frame. Enter `python3 fileName.py` to run your files. You can use `pip3 install frameName` or upload a wheel to install a frame.
## ☄ Where is the jupyter file path?
- `/code`
- We can use `!pwd` to get the current path.
## ☄ What is the python version?
- We can choose the mirror when we rent the machine.
  - For pytorch1.1 version mirror, the default are python3.5 and python2.7. And we can use `conda activate python367` to activate python3.67, and `conda deactivate` to go back.
  - For pytorch1.4 version mirror, python3.67 has been activated. After deactivating, they are python3.7 and python2.7.
## ☄ How to forward server port for tensorboard/jupyter, etc?
- Method 1. Configure the x11-forwarding to forward server GUI, and then launch the browser on the server.
- Method 2
  - Open mobaXterm's tunnel
  - ![](resource/r26.png)
  - Fill out the forwarding information.
  - Start it
  - ![](resource/r28.png)
  - Open recived port on your local browser, for example: `127.0.0.1:6006`.
## ☄ How to transfer files?
- For small files, you can transfer them through the left graphical interface of the MobaXterm.
- For large files, it is recommended to transfer through the private network disk provided in the email you receive at the time of rental, which is fast.
## ☄ Will the data be saved after expiration?
- When the lease expires, the container will be deactivated. If your wallet balance is less than 20000DBC, the container will be destroyed immediately. If your wallet balance exceeds 20000DBC, all data will be automatically retained for 7 days (the wallet balance must also exceed 20000DBC during this period).
- In addition, data can be saved by renting the CPU container, and no charge will be incurred by pledging DBC, but the charge will be charged by renting it.
## ☄ What are the charging rules?
- The price of each machine is different, so it is recommended to choose the most cost-effective one.
- You can withdraw the rental in advance, only the actual fees will be charged, and the remaining fees will be returned to your wallet.
